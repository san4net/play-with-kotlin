## java vs kotlin

## Kotlin for server side
 - Kotlin is a great fit for developing server-side applications. It allows you to write concise and expressive code while maintaining full compatibility with existing Java-based technology stacks, all with a smooth learning curve:

- Expressiveness: Kotlin's innovative language features, such as its support for type-safe builders and delegated properties, help build powerful and easy-to-use abstractions.

- Scalability: Kotlin's support for coroutines helps build server-side applications that scale to massive numbers of clients with modest hardware requirements.

- Interoperability: Kotlin is fully compatible with all Java-based frameworks, so you can use your familiar technology stack while reaping the benefits of a more modern language.

- Migration: Kotlin supports gradual migration of large codebases from Java to Kotlin. You can start writing new code in Kotlin while keeping older parts of your system in Java.

- Tooling: In addition to great IDE support in general, Kotlin offers framework-specific tooling (for example, for Spring) in the plugin for IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.

- Learning Curve: For a Java developer, getting started with Kotlin is very easy. The automated Java-to-Kotlin converter included in the Kotlin plugin helps with the first steps. Kotlin Koans can guide you through the key features of the language with a series of interactive exercise
